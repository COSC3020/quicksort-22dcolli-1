# Quicksort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) version of quicksort. Use the
template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some
basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

Hint: To make quicksort iterative, think about the part of the array each
recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

## Plagarism Statement

All exercises must contain the following statement:
“I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use
of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated
otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is
suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.”

## Note
I am attempting this from scratch, I will compare it to my last semesters repository and make any corrections needed base on that.

## Answer
The worst case scenario for this quicksort is also the same as a standard quicksort, that being $\Theta(n^2)$. My reasoning for this is that in both algorithms, the worst case revolves around the pivot selection causing iteration for every element of a set. So because the same issue can happen in both quicksorts, the worst case scenario would also be the same.
